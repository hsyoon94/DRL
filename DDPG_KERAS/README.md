# keras-ddpg
Python keras + tensorflow implementation of DDPG solving modified open gymAI pendulum-v0 environment

Corrected and modified implementation from [Reinforcement Learning w/ Keras + OpenAI: Actor-Critic Models](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-w-keras-openai-actor-critic-models-f084612cfd69)
of DDPG using keras + tensorflow. 

It solves open gymAI pendulum-v0 environment

About METHOD:
[Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)

# How to run
python ac_pendulum.py

It shows animation every 5 episodes.
It reaches desired behaviour after around 40-60 episodes.
